# Food Delivery Chatbot with Dialogflow

This repository contains the code for building a chatbot for a food delivery system using Dialogflow. Throughout this project, I embarked on an end-to-end development journey, delving into various aspects such as Dialogflow basics, backend development in Python with FastAPI, interaction with a MySQL database, and beyond. This experience provided me with a comprehensive understanding and practical implementation of Dialogflow fundamentals, including intents, entities, contexts, and more.
